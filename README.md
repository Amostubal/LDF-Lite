#### introduction:
This is LD-lite - Legendary Dwarf Fortress Lite Version, a mod pack collaboration lead in development by Amostubal.  We take many liberties in the creation of this pack, but first and foremost we will always showcase the writers of the modificiations we use.  Mods are fully installed with only the changes necessary to allow compliance between the mods and the base of LDF. <additional information to follow here>

#### install instructions:

Step 1.

Since this is the Lite Version, you will need a fresh install of DF, DFHack, and TWBT.  The pack is last updated to DF 44.02, and DFHack and TWBT 44.02alpha-r1.  You can get this from say the LNP pack by peridex or you can build it completely yourself by downloading them individually and installing them one by one.



Step 2.

Download the LDF-Lite pack.  The pack comes in a number of zipped formats, so make a choice and downnload it already! 



Step 3.

Now go into your new install of DF, and delete its raw/objects folder. You really want to do this as many files are changed and some deprecated. I will try to in the future, add blank files for the DF files that are removed.  but for not just understand the pack has all the rawcodes you need.



Step 4.
Unzip the pack; as it is a fully integrated pack its file structure is already stored inside the pack.  so on most systems you should be able to just copy the dwarf fortress folder in the pack over the new dwarf fortress install you just made.  Any files that ask you to replace, select yes.

And that should be it!  Enjoy!
