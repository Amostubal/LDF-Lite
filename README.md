#### introduction:
This is LDF - Legendary Dwarf Fortress, a mod pack collaboration lead in development by Amostubal.  We take many liberties in the creation of this pack, but first and foremost we will always showcase the writers of the modificiations we use.  Mods are fully installed with only the changes necessary to allow compliance between the mods and the base of LDF. <additional information to follow here>

#### install instructions:

The pack comes in a number of zipped formats, as it is a fully integrated pack its file structure is already stored inside the pack,  simple unzip to its a new folder.  Do not install a new version of LDF over a previous installed version of LDF.  Do not install over a preivious install of any Dwarf Fortress base or mod pack.  Doing so will cause unknown issues.
