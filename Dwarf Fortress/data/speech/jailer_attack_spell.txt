Your mind will break!
Beg for release, mortal!
You are mine now!
I will burn away your defiance!
Resistance will only bring pain!
Your mind will give out!
So weak of will!
Too delicate to survive!
Mortal minds break so easily. It is...unsatisfying.
Poor soul, and you think I am the cruel one?
