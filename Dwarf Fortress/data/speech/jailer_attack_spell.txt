Your mind will break!
Beg for release, mortal!
You are mine now!
I will burn away your defiance!
Resistance will only bring pain!
Your mind will give out!
So weak of will!
Too delicate to survive!
Mortal minds break so easily. It is...unsatisfying.
Poor soul, and you think I am the cruel one?
A new prisoner for the taking.
Another soul for the Legion.
I am your judge, jury, and executioner.
So eager to be enslaved.
Your soul will be mine.
Foolish mortal! You are mine now!
The Legion will devour you!
This world will burn!
Your soul is mine!
You cannot escape the Legion!
The Legion is eternal!
