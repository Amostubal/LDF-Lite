Your suffering will be legend!
How much can you withstand?
This will hurt...I promise!
I will cut you to the core!
Feed me with your screams!
Fragile mortal.
The full might of the Legion falls upon you!
Your flesh will burn!
This world will belong to the Legion!
Fuel for the fel...
Fresh meat dangles for the taking!
A fate worse than death awaits you, little mortal!
Die!
Do you crave death, mortal?
You have gone far enough, mortal. This ends here.
Your life is forfeit!
All you know, all you hold dear, will fall!
Fool! The Legion you know is but a whisper of our true glory.
Good! Some entertainment! I was getting restless!
All who rise against the Legion are doomed!
You are no match for me!
All in my shadow will crumble and fall!
We will make your death terrible, and your suffering long.
Our hatred knows no bounds!
Your souls will fuel our engines!
Pathetic worm.
