I spit on you!
Your entrails will make a fine necklace!
You come to die!
Sniveling pig!
Begone!
I will take pleasure in gutting you...
Die, maggot!
I will feed you to the dogs!
The kings will spit on you, worm!
I'll eat your heart!
I'll drink your blood!
Beg for your life...
Suffer, insect!
Your end draws closer!
You tiny creatures disgust me!
Your people are a disease upon the world!
Look what's come to play.
Pray to your gods for a quick death!
Come, outsider filth!
I will break you!
You will bleed!
I will sharpen my blade with your bones!
I will flay you!
I will bathe in your blood!
I will wear your bones!
You cannot escape!
