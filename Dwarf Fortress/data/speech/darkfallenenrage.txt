I will feast on your remains.
Your heartbeat is music to my ears.
So appetizing.
Fresh, warm blood. It has been too long.
No mercy for the weak!
I shall consume you!
Your blood is mine!
Darkness waits.
Blood will flow.
Truth is found in death.
Delight in the pain!
Beg for mercy!
Worm food.
My cup runneth over.
Dinner...is served.
Bow down before the Darkfallen!
None can resist my thirst!
The hunger never ends!
