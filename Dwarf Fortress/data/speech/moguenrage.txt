You will feel pain.
You have made a grave mistake.
Kneel!
Die!
Submit!
Enough of this!
You are not the first to challenge me, and you will not be the last!
My might is endless!
Fall to your knees!
I tire of your insolence!
Stare into the face of true power!
Fall at my feet!
This world will burn.
Submit or die, you fool!
Know your place!
I will teach you some respect!
You'll learn to serve!
Bow down!
The weak have no place in this world!
