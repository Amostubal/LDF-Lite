Die, dog!
You dare to challenge me?
The master's will be done!
Face me!
No mercy! No rest!
I'll paint my face with your blood!
I am a warrior born!
I'll destroy you all!
Face a true soldier of the Lich King!
Look what's come to play.
My life for the master!
For the master!
I will break you!
You tiny creatures disgust me!
There will be no everlasting life for you!
Fight without mercy!
Only the strong will survive!
Crush them!
Take their heads!
Split them open!
Leave none alive!
We are the King's men!
The Lich King will rule!
In the name of the Lich King!
