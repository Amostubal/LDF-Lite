Tremble before me!
What trickery is this?
I bring darkness!
You fail to amuse me.
Pitiful!
What a foolish ploy!
To the slaughter!
I go to destroy!
This will please me!
The Legion will consume you all!
Fear the Legion's might!
I AM UNSTOPPABLE!
Die, mongrel!
Fall to your knees!
Your end has come!
Your flesh will burn!
None can oppose us!
A worthy effort...but futile. 
I am the destructor!
Squirm...Scream!
Useless!
Fall and die before me!
Perish, insect!
Bring the fight to me!
Another day, another glorious battle!
I live for this!
No one is going to save you.
Perish, insect!
You are meat!
Only flesh and blood...
Come, face your doom!
You will know pain!
I will delight on your suffering!
I'll smash you to pieces!
I will flatten you!
I will pummel you to dust!
You dare challenge me!
I will break you!
Let us test your resolve!
You cannot withstand me!
