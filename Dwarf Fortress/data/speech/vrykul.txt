whose size was a disadvantage in battle
whose eyes I scooped out with my bare hands
whose violent nature couldn't match my own
who was a disgrace to [PRO_POS] kin
an opponent worthy of my skill
who should have remained in [PRO_POS] grim, frozen lands
who put up a good fight
whose family will not mourn [PRO_POS] passing
