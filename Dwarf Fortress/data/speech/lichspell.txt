Where do you think you're going?
Your spirit shall freeze.
Feel the chill of despair.
I will freeze your soul!
You will know the chill of death.
Embrace the cold.
I will freeze the blood in your veins!
There will be no escape.
Your soul cannot withstand my power!
The chill that you feel is the herald of your doom!
It will be much colder in your grave.
Succumb to the icy chill of death!
I am the hand of the Lich King!
