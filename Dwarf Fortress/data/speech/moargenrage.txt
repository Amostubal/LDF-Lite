You've come a long way just to die.
Are you so eager to take the place of my next meal?
I'll guzzle your blood!
Don't bother running, flea...
Tremble beneath me.
Out with the refuse.
I'll stomp you!
I predict a painful death.
Measure twice; cut once.
If my division is correct, you should be quite dead.
You have approximately five seconds to live.
Your survival is improbable!
