You will die, wastrel!
You will hang on a cross!
Die, degenerate!
You are no match, weakling!
Another kill to my name!
Run away!
You're mine!
You won't escape me!
You are no match for us!
To die for the Caesar is an honor!
Death to the Caesar's enemies!
The weak must die!
Defend yourself, scum!
You belong on a cross, degenerate!
Despicable scum! You will know pain!
You shall be crucified, dissolute one!
