The time is now...
Fall before the Scourge!
Be drained of life.
You may feel a sting.
I'll consume the living and the dead!
Oblivion awaits!
Feel the venom of Nerub!
Raid!
The Scourge will devour all!
This place will be your tomb!
Eternal agony awaits you!
Just a little taste...
There is no way out.
Shhh...it will all be over soon.
Yes, run! It makes the blood pump faster!
Come into my parlor, little fly...
Only scraps will remain!
I'll crush your bones to powder!
Your strength means nothing!
Bleed and die, vermin.
I crave the smell of freshly spilled blood. How convenient that you are here.
Give in, mortals! Your will cannot hold out against the Scourge!
