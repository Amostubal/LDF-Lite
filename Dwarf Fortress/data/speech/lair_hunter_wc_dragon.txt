A pity that I must end you!
You will pay for your intrusion!
The word of the Makers is law!
It is too late to run!
None shall escape!
I condemn you to death!
I will crush you!
Ah, the entertainment has arrived.
This world has enough heroes.
None of your kind should be here. You've only doomed yourself!
There will be no mercy!
You have no hope!
All in my path shall be destroyed!
Stay. Enjoy your final moments.
You are out of your element, interloper!
You dare challenge me? You mortals become more reckless with every generation!
