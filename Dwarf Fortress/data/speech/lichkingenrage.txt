All must die!
Hope wanes...
The end has come!
Face now your tragic end!
You will know endless torment!
Your pain shall be legendary!
Faithless coward!
Bow down before your lord and master!
I'll make sure you suffer!
Death calls for you.
Miserable wretch!
You are a fool.
Mortal fool.
This ends with your death.
I bring death.
I am death!
Judgment is at hand!
Die, worm!
Prepare to be humbled.
You are like wheat before the scythe...
Feel the justice of the grave.
Cower before your king!
There is fear in your heart!
Embrace the darkness!
Despair, mortal!
The world will be mine.
Fall into darkness, "hero"!
Serve me and live!
Feel the power of a God!
