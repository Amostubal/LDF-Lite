My fate is sealed!
The master's will be done!
Death shall reign.
Let life cease!
Fear the Reaper!
I'm sanctified!
This is the hour of the Scourge!
Death shall cleanse the world!
Let blood drown the weak!
The living be cursed!
The Shadows beckon!
Let darkness guide me!
Die!
Tremble before the Scourge!
None shall survive!
Let battle be joined!
Feel my wrath!
Ride or die!
Let terror reign!
Blood and IRON!!!
Faithless coward!
Glory to the Scourge!
I'll make sure you suffer.
Your pain shall be legendary!
You will know endless torment!
Death is the only escape!
Stand and fight!
Show me what you've got!
Defend yourself!
Your life is mine!
You seek death?
None shall pass.
Be still!
You will find no peace in death.
Bow to the might of the Scourge!
You are mine now.
I see you...
You...are next.
The end is upon you.
Soon...the world will tremble.
Glory to the master!
Your life is forfeit.
Die, trespasser!
Run while you still can!
Pathetic wretch!
You cannot hide from me!
Slay them in the master's name!
Kneel before me, worm!
No mercy!
None can stand against us!
Split them open!
Leave none alive!
In the name of the Lich King!
We are the King's men!
Glory to the Lich King!
You will submit!
