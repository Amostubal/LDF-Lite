I must break you!
Your spirit is mine!
Your soul will pay the price!
You will die here!
This is just the beginning! We won't just roll over and die!
I'll feed you to the crows!
Our empire will be united once more!
Turn away, weaklings!
All will fall before us!
Our gods will drink your blood!
Your skull will make a fine ornament for my tusks.
