Fight me and die, coward!
This should be good!
I will crush you!
Die with honor!
A glorious fight!
I shall claim the honor of your death!
Come, show me your fury!
A puny outsider challenges me?
The undeserving will perish!
Unworthy!
You'll die as you lived: without honor!
Do you really hope to best me?
Every opponent has a weakness. I will find yours!
Yield now!
Behold my strength!
You will not win this fight!
I will take joy of crushing you!
I will put an end to you!
I deem you unworthy.
Little more than a nuisance!
Leave here or die!
You have chosen death!
I shall stain this ground with your blood!
Come closer if you want to die!
