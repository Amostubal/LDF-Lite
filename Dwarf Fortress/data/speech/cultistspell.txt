Your death approaches.
This ordeal will end soon.
How unfortunate.
Your resistance puzzles me.
Your persistence is irksome.
My sorcery is insurmountable!
Unspeakable horror awaits you.
You will serve me well.
Enjoy your last breaths.
You will join me after your death.
I will put you down, dog.
My dark magics will overwhelm you.
