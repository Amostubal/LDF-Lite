Brief descriptions of all playable, civilized Warcraft races, by ZM5.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Naga - snake-like beings, formerly elves. They live in cities, usually made in the wetlands. They will send out snatchers, making them hostile.

Naga caravans can bring two forms of weapons that are rarely found elsewhere - tridents, which use the pike skill, 
and katars, a type of fist weapon useful mostly for stabbing.

The Naga themselves have several different castes.

Regular male and female naga vary slightly - males have only one pair of arms, whereas females have two. 
Males have a stronger venomous bite, which can cause intense pain and necrosis - females only cause weaker pain.

Sea Witches are further mutated naga females, having three pairs of arms, and snakes instead of hair.
Their snake hair provides an additional way to attack - similarly to hydras, they will attack with multiple bits of their snake hair at once.
Both their regular and snake bites can inject a venom thats more similar to that of the males.
They also can use some forms of magic - they can shoot frost bolts at up to 3 targets at once, or shoot liquid frost or liquid lightning in order to cause syndromes.

Naga Anomalies are further mutated naga males. They have protective shell-like growths over most of their bodies, including their heads.
As their eyes are not visible, they cannot be blinded. Their scratches can also inject a powerful venom that can cause intense pain, necrosis, and bleeding.

Naga Brutes are another mutated male form. They have six eyes and an ape-like posture, still possessing their legs. They are the largest of the naga.

All naga swim at a faster speed than most other creatures, and can use a Battle Fury interaction that temporarily increases strength and toughness.

They have access to razor coral weapons - razor coral is a relatively light but very sharp material, perfect for edged weapons.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orc - large-sized green-skinned humanoids. They live in cities built in the savannas, deserts and shrublands.

Orcs are one of the races with access to japanese-inspired weapons, such as naginatas, katanas, kamas and kusarigamas, which their caravans may occasionally bring.

Orcs have higher innate strength and endurance than most other races - they also can use a berserker rage interaction that temporarily increases strength and agility.
They are also more fearless, and are less likely to run away from battles.

Orcs are one of the races that can make Arcanite, a highly powerful metal that improves on the qualities of Thorium.

Drinking a volatile brew of strength as an orc will turn them into a Dire Orc, increasing strength and size, but lowering the speed at which they learn skills.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vrykul - half-giant humanoids, who live in towns in the temperate forests, taigas and mountains.

They have access to several rare weapons, which they may bring in caravans - 
harpoon launchers, dragonslayers (massive swords which are slow to swing but can do a lot of damage), and bearded axes.

They are less likely to run away from combat, being more brave and excitement seeking. They also learn every combat skill at twice the usual rates.

Vrykul are one of the races that can make Titansteel - a powerful metal that combines and improves on the properties of both Titanium and Steel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
N'raqi - also called the faceless ones, they are deformed servants of horrifying, elder deities. 
They live in fortresses found in the taigas, tundras, mountains and temperate coniferous forests.

They will send out snatchers in worldgen, and so are hostile to most other races by default.

They come in several varieties.

Unbroken are the most common and also the smallest caste. They have a single deformed arm and a tentacle instead of the other arm.

Faceless Ones are more rare and larger, but otherwise have the same type of body as the Unbroken.

The C'thrax are a gigantic, rare caste that serve as the military leaders. Instead of tentacles, they have two arms with pincers, and six vestigial arms
coming from their back. They do not feel pain, and can slam the ground to release a wave of dust that knocks creatures around. They also have a protective layer
of carapace over most of their body. They have adept striking, kicking, wrestling and fighting, and adequate dodging.

The Starspawn are the largest, and most rare caste, serving as their civilization leaders. They resemble the smaller faceless ones, though they have two tentacles
instead of a deformed arm and a single tentacle. They have accomplished skill in fighting, striking, wrestling, kicking, and maces, and adept in dodging.
They can use three different spells - Mind Flay, which causes dizziness and pain, Maddening Whispers, which has a chance of driving a creature to attack everything nearby,
and also the Destruction Construct's Oblivion spell.

All of the Faceless One castes don't feel fear, and do not need to eat, drink or sleep.

The N'raqi are capable of utilizing Saronite, a material thats extremely powerful all-around.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draconian - draconic humanoids, living in cities in the forests.

Similarly to the Naga, they have access to tridents, which they may bring occasionally in caravans.

They also have several variations.

Drakonids are the largest, and most common caste. They have a humanoid build, and learn most combat skills at twice the usual rate - with the exception
of pikes and spears, which they learn at four times the usual rate.

Dragonspawn are the second most common, and are also the second smallest. They have a centauroid build instead, and similarly to the drakonids they learn
weapon skills at twice the usual rate - with the exception of swords, hammers, axes and maces, which they learn at four times the usual rate.

Dragonkin are as common as the dragonspawn, and are the smallest caste - they have a humanoid build like the drakonids, but also possess a pair of wings that lets them fly.
Instead of learning combat skills at twice the usual rate, they instead learn nearly all types of manual labors at twice the usual rate.

Drakonar are the rarest and second biggest caste - they have most of the features of the others, including a pair of wings and a centauroid build.
They can also spit a ball of magma, or breathe a stream of heated gas that can cause melting damage.
They learn combat skills at twice the usual rates - with spears, pikes, swords, hammers, axes and maces at four times the usual rate.

Similarly to the Vrykul, Draconians can make Titansteel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nerubian - spider-like humanoids who live in fortresses in the mountains, taigas, tundras, and temperate coniferous forests.

Standard nerubians can be both male or female - they consist of a humanoid torso on six spider-like legs.
They can spray a stream of webbing to immobilize their foes, and also use a battle fury self-buff.

Spiderlords are massive, four-legged male nerubians that are more similar to beetles. They possess a tough carapace
that adds protection, a single horn, and also a pair of scythe-like blades sprouting from their hands that can be devastating in combat.
They also serve as the sole rulers of nerubian civilizations. They only have 2 eyes, as opposed to the 8 of the regular nerubians,
and also lack the web spray attack.

Spiderseers are female only, and walk on two pairs of legs. They have two pairs of arms and 6 eyes.
Aside from the web spray, they can also use Mind Flay similarly to the Starspawn, and also Curse of Fatigue, which lowers speed and strength to 70% of their normal.

All Nerubians are immune to being webbed, and can climb even when missing arms.

Additionally, Nerubians are capable of making Saronite, and are the only way of getting the material without fighting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gorian Ogre - large, brutish, horned humanoids living in cities in the savannas, deserts, grasslands and shrublands.

Although they have access to most weapon categories, they mostly prefer blunt weapons and axes.
They will send out thieves in worldgen, making them hostile to most other races.

Ogres have three varieties - one-headed and two-headed. 
One-headed ogres can use berserker rage; however they learn most of the precise, non-combat skills, such as medical jobs, at 25% the usual rate.

Two-headed ogres use battle fury instead, and learn precise skills at twice the usual rates, though they do not learn combat skills as fast as the normal ogres - they also are the leaders of ogre civilizations.
The third ogre type are the Primal Ogres, also known as Ogre Lords - they are cyclopean ogres with three horns made out of stone, and stone-like growths on their backs.
They are larger than the other ogre types, and learn precise skills at even lesser rates - however, their combat skills are gained extremely quickly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draenei - benevolent, hooved humanoids, who live in cities in the grasslands, savannas, and shrublands.

They have access to nearly every type of blunt weapon, and will rarely start wars in worldgen.

Male draenei have facial tentacles, whereas females have a pair of horns instead. 
A second, mutated variant, called the Broken, lack either of those features - they also learn skills at half the usual rate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lost One - further mutated Draenei, who split off from the rest of their civilizations. 
They live exclusively in forest retreats, in any forests of the world.

They have access to various weaponry, but mostly prefer swords and scythe-like weapons.

They will send out thieves in worldgen, and as such will be hostile to most other civs.

They learn ambusher skill at eight times the normal rate, and can also use shadowmeld in order to instantly enter stealth.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demon - a race of evil beings, living in cities in the forests and deserts of the world.

They have many different variants that are technically separate races - for the purpose of the game they are considered one "race".

Variants:

Mo'arg - large, humanoid demons - they learn mechanics and siegecrafting at double the usual rate. They can use a berserker rage interaction.

Annihilan - powerful, massive centauroid demons. They have two tusks, and a pair of wings - although, they cannot fly due to being too heavy.
They can use a berserker rage interaction. They can also use Howl of Terror, which aside from inducing horror and fright in those affected, also cuts
their strength in half.
Regular orcs who drink their blood can become fel orcs.
They learn most melee weapon skills at three times the usual rate. They also have higher innate strength, toughness, and endurance.

Nathrezim - large, humanoid demons with hooves, wings, and a pair of horns.
They gain various conversational skills at increased rates.

Shivarra (female)/Shivan(male) - tall, humanoid demons with six arms. They have a higher innate social awareness than most other races.
Similarly to the Nathrezim, they learn most conversational skills at highly increased rates. Unlike the Nathrezim, they only use
a battle fury interaction, and don't possess any innate magical knowledge - however, they learn sword skill at four times the normal rate.

Gan'arg - diminutive demons skilled at mechanics, related to the Felguards and Mo'arg.
They learn mechanics, siegecrafting and siege operating at four times the usual rate - however, they will often
flee from combat at the first sign of resistance.

Along with the Annihilan and Nathrezim, they serve as military leaders.

Eredar - medium-sized, demonically corrupted Draenei. They have similar features as the regular Draenei,
with males having facial tentacles and females having horns. They are offensive spellcasters - they can shoot
fireballs or bolts of felfire, and also cast Curse of Agony.

Eredar Brute - mutated, male Eredar. They have a pair of sharp horns, and as such their gore attacks can tear muscle and possibly sever limbs.
Attacks against them have their force halved. As with the regular Eredar, they can use a battle fury interaction, though they lack the spells.

are capable of piercing vital organs. Like the Eredar brutes, they lack the spellcasting abilities of the regular Eredar.

Terrorfiend - large demons with wings, hooves, and six horns - they appear to have two heads, an eyeless one in its normal
spot, and one jutting from its torso. Both have maws of fanged teeth, and can bite with both sets of teeth.
They also learn mace and hammer skills at four times the usual rate. They share similar military duties as the Ered'ruin.

Wyrmtongue - diminutive demons with tails and horns - they are the smallest out of all demon castes.

and they learn most weapon skills, along with dodging, at 1.2 the usual rate, fighting, archery, weapon and armor-forging at twice the usual rate,
and sword skill at three times the usual rate.

Inquisitor - eyeless demons with horns - they are only floating torsos with a spinal cord instead of the lower body.
They can sense most living creatures even in uncovered areas, similarly to vampires.
They have two buff spells - Fel Strength and Haste - the first temporarily adds 1500 strength and 300 toughness, the latter increases speed to 120%
and adds 800 points to agility. 
They also have an offensive spell, Shadow Word, which has a 25% chance of causing immediate debilitating pain, knocking the target out, and also lowers
willpower to 90% of what it usually is.

Jailer - floating torso demons with horns - like the Inquisitors, they have several spells, though the Jailer is more offensively minded.
They can cast Soul Drain, which causes drowsiness and reduces strength, agility and endurance to 90%; Anguish, which has a chance of making a creature
hostile to everything around it, causes pain in the nervous tissue, and also makes said creature more prone to anger - and Intensify Rage, a buff that prevents nearby demons from feeling fear
and makes them more violent and prone to anger.

Antaen - colossal, horned demons, almost as large as most giants. Despite this, they are quite intelligent. They learn mechanics and siege engineering at a 1.7 rate,
and are capable of a berserker rage interaction. They are one of the most rare types of demons.

Demons have access to several types of weapons and tools rarely seen elsewhere - double-bladed polearms, a favoured weapon of the Annihilan, which uses the spear skill,
Hammer Gauntlets, a large, blunt fist weapon, Pincer Gauntlets, another large fist weapon that uses edged attacks instead, Excavator Gauntlets, which can be used
as mining picks, and Buzz-saw Gauntlets, which use the axe skill and can be used to chop down trees.
They also use Rivet Guns and Scrap Guns similar to those of the goblins.

Demons will send out baby snatchers and thieves in world gen, making them hostile to most other races.

They, along with other demonic races, can make Felsteel, a powerful material that is highly effective for sharp weapons.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iron Guardian - metallic, mechanical constructs. They live in mountain fortresses.

All iron guardian varieties dont feel pain, and do not need to eat, breathe, drink or sleep.

Varieties:

Iron Dwarves - most common caste, they have the same size as regular dwarves, only being made out of different materials.
They learn mining, stonecrafting, masonry and engraving at twice the usual rate.

Iron Vrykul - third most common caste, they are the same size as the vrykul.
They learn fighting, archery, glassmaking, leatherworking, gem cutting, gem encrusting, stonecrafting, woodcrafting,
metalcrafting and bone carving at twice the usual rate.

Mechagnome - second most common caste, also the smallest of all iron guardians. While the other iron guardians
do not feel fear, the mechagnomes will run at the first sign of opposition.
They learn architecture, mechanics, siegecrafting and siege operating at twice the usual rate.

Iron Giant - the most rare caste of the iron guardians - they are around the same size as the various wild giants.
They learn smelting, strand extraction, metalcrafting, architecture, weapon, armor and metalsmithing at twice the usual rate.

Iron guardians have similar weapon loadouts as the dwarves - they prefer flintlocks, muskets and blunderbuses, and don't use crossbows.
They can also make Titansteel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fel Orc - demonically corrupted orcs, living in dark pits in the savannas and temperate forests.

They are bigger than regular orcs, and have many spiky growths all over their bodies. 

They can use a berserker rage buff, and their weapon loadouts are a combination of the demon and orc weapons.

Fel orcs are massively more prone to rage than most other races. They also can make Felsteel.

Drinking a volatile brew of strength as a Fel Orc will turn them into a Dire Fel Orc, increasing strength and size, but lowering the speed at which they learn skills.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forest/Ice/Jungle/Sand/Dark Troll - put in one category, as they are mostly similar, with the exceptions of size
and skin colours. They are tall, lanky humanoids with tusks, found inhabiting many different environments.

Forest Trolls live in cities in the temperate forests of the world.
Dark Trolls live in forest retreats in the temperate marshes of the world.
Jungle Trolls live in cities in the tropical forests.
Sand Trolls live in cities in the savannas and deserts.
Ice Trolls live in cities in the taigas and mountains.

Jungle and Sand trolls are the same size - Forest and Ice trolls also share the same size, being larger than the Jungle/Sand Trolls. 
Dark Trolls, however, are bigger and also more prone to rage than all other trolls.

Their weapon loadouts all have slight differences - for example, Ice trolls are the only ones to use harpoon launchers.
Most notably, their shared weapons include edged tonfas and two-bladed swords, both of which are somewhat rare.

Aside from Jungle trolls, all troll types send out thieves in worldgen, making them hostile to most other civs.

Drinking a volatile brew of strength as any Troll will turn them into a Dire Troll, increasing strength and size, but lowering the speed at which they learn skills.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gorloc - amphibious humanoids, related to the murlocs. They live in forest retreats in the tropical forests.

They are smaller than dwarves, and their civs will most likely be non-hostile.

Similarly to most amphibious races, they swim faster than other creatures, and also have access to tridents.
Their weapon loadouts are otherwise similar to most primitive races. They also have access to razor coral weaponry.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuskarr - peaceful, walrus-like humanoids living in cities in the taigas and temperate coniferous forests.

Highly unlikely to be at war with the players civ - their caravans come during the winter, which may prove useful.

Similarly to other races living in colder regions, they have access to harpoon launchers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wolvar - wolverine-like humanoids, rivals of the gorlocs. They live in forest retreats in the tropical forests.

They will send item thieves in worldgen and as such will be hostile to most other races.

With the exception of tonfas, most of their weapon loadout is shared with other primitive races.
They are a lot more prone to rage than most other races.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quilboar - boar-like humanoids with spiny backs and four tusks. They live in towns in the savannas and deserts.

Their weapon loadouts are similar to those of the ogres - including most types of maces, axes and hammers.

They are also more prone to rage than most other creatures.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furbolg - bear-like humanoids, who live in forest retreats in the temperate forests.

They will not scare wildlife, and are more prone to rage.

Furbolgs use mostly various types of primitve, metal weapons - machetes, spiked clubs, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arakkoa - bird-like humanoids, who come in two variants. They live in cities in the mountains and tropical forests.

There are two types of arakkoa - standard arakkoa, who are smaller and flightless, and the High Arakkoa, who are taller and have wings on their arms
that enable flight.

Although unlikely, the Arakkoa may be at war with the players civ, due to conflicting ethics. However they do not send thieves or baby snatchers.

Although they have access to most types of weapons, they mostly prefer swords - including the relatively rare
ceremonial swords.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drogbar - large, brutish humanoids who live in fortresses in the shrublands, grasslands and mountains.

Slightly more prone to rage than other races - however, they are unlikely to be at war with the players civ.
They do not send out thieves in worldgen.

Their favoured weapons are mostly large, blunt weapons - they use some types of two-handed swords too, however,
including dragonslayers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tol'vir - centauroid, feline humanoids. They live in cities in the deserts and savannas.

They are the only race to use khopesh swords - aside from that, they have several other types of 
rare weapons, like war sickles and war scythes.

Like the Iron guardians and Vrykul, they can make Titansteel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tauren - peaceful, bovine humanoids with hooves and horns.

They can use a battle fury interaction, however they are benign and will not start fights.

They mostly use larger weapons, like two-handed swords or axes. They also have access to good animals, and may trade them in caravans.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primal - plant-like beings who live in forest retreats in the forests and wetlands of the world.

Variants:

Podlings - small humanoids - the most common caste. Despite their small size, they enrage easily and can use a berserker rage self-buff.

Botani - medium-sized humanoids. They are mostly made out of wood - as such, their punches and kicks hit noticably harder.
They have two spells - a Wither spell, that reduces strength and speed to 50%, and a Raise Shambler spell, that turns a single corpse
into a docile puppet shambler. Puppet shamblers usually wont attack enemies unless they themselves are attacked - they will spread
spores that can cause nausea, swelling of the lungs, vomiting blood and coughing blood.

Infested - large humanoids infested by a parasitic organism. They have several plant growths on their bodies, and vines
extending from their lower arms. Using their vines they can either lash or stab - stabs can inject parasitic pods into other creatures -
this has a possibility of turning the affected creature into an infested shambler, a lesser, crazed version of the infested that will
lash out at anything nearby.

Genesaur - gargantuan centauroids with two tusks - usually only one per primal civ, serving as the leader of the civilization.
They can use a Battle Roar interaction that makes nearby friendly creatures not feel fear, and also more violent.
They can also reanimate a single, friendly primal back to life.

Primal Ancient - a large but relatively rare caste, similar to the Ancients, although far less benevolent.
They can cast two spells - Accelerate Decay, similarly to the green dragons, and Sunbeam, similarly to the Nature
Keepers.

Primals can use razor wood in their weapons - a unique material that, while sharing the same density as regular wood, is also a lot more
sharp. Otherwise they may use standard wooden weapons.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qiraji - insect-like humanoids, who live in fortresses in the deserts.

They send out babysnatchers in worldgen, and will as such be hostile to most races.

They use more wicked weapons, like war sickles, war scythes, macuahuitls and so on.

All Qiraji can use a battle fury interaction.

Variants:

Standard Qiraji are bipedal, and are covered in a strong carapace, offering some amount of protection.
Two regular Qiraji will also always be the rulers of a qiraji civ. 

Qiraji Gladiators are giant male Qiraji, and instead of hands have a pair of pincers. They also have a single horn
and two large mandibles. Similarly to most other Qiraji, they are covered in a tough carapace. They are quite deadly even
when unarmed.

Qiraji Swarmguards are small, female Qiraji. They have 4 wings, enabling flight, and two scythe-like blades in their arms.
Unlike the other Qiraji, they aren't as durable due to lacking any form of carapace - however their arm scythes make up for that.

Eight-legged Qiraji (or Qiraji Prophets) are larger, male Qiraji. They are the spellcasters - they also have a strange
breastplate-like protrusion on their upper body, which also bears a small pincer that can attack.
They can cast Mind Flay, causing pain and dizziness, Dominate Mind, which has a chance of causing a creature
to lash out at nearby other creatures, and Terrifying Vision, which makes a creature more likely to flee from combat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Night Elf - tall humanoids with purple skin, living in towns in tropical forests.

They can use a battle fury interaction, as well as Shadowmeld, which lets them instantly enter stealth.

Additionally, they have access to several rare types of weapons - including war glaives, moon glaives, and umbra
crescents. Similarly to vanilla DF elves, they don't like being traded wooden goods - unlike the DF elves, they use
metal equipment and can be rather deadly.

They are the only race that can make Elunite, a lightweight but resistant material, good for edged weapons and decent for armor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High Elf - tall humanoids with glowing blue eyes, living in cities in the forests.

They are unlikely to be at war with the player civ, and may be worth trading with. 

They can use a battle fury interaction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Elf - elves related to high elves - they live in cities in the forests.

Although their values are somewhat different than those of the high elves, they are nonetheless unlikely
to be at war with the player. They too can use a battle fury interaction.

Blood elves also have access to two-bladed swords and war glaives - it may be worth trading for them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fel Elf - demonically corrupted high/blood elves, living in dark pits in the forests.

They send out baby snatchers and thieves during worldgen, making them hostile.

They come in three different variants.

Felblood elves are the most common and "standard" variant - they are larger than regular high and blood elves.
They also possess a pair of horns and a pair of wings - although, they cannot fly.

The Wretched are elves who overindulged in their magical addiction - they are covered in tumors and they have a
light blue eye glow. They are smaller than other elves, however they can cast a Drain Energy spell that causes dizziness
and reduces endurance to 50%.

The Winnowed are a further mutation of the Wretched - their eyes instead glow green, and they are larger.
Aside from the Energy Drain, they can cast Withering Curse, which reduces toughness to 40% and causes the affected
creature to cough up blood. 
They also always secrete black, necrotic drool from their mouths - their bites can spatter it over wounds, causin necrosis
and swelling.

All variants can use a battle fury self-buff. They can also make felsteel equipment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nightborne - relatives of the Night Elves, who live in cities in tropical forests.

They possess a similar battle fury interaction, however they cannot Shadowmeld. They also do not have
war glaives or umbra crescents, only being able to use moon glaives.

Variants:

Standard Nightborne are the most common caste, and also the second biggest.

Nightfallen are weakened, emaciated nightborne - they are smaller and weaker due to being deprived of their energy.

The Fal'dorei are mutated, spider-like nightborne. Males have ten eyes and three pairs of legs, whereas females have only
two eyes and two pairs of legs - both are capable of spraying webs at enemy creatures - they themselves are also immune to being webbed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satyr - demonically corrupted night elves, who have goat-like features, including hooves and horns.
They live in forest retreats in tropical forests.

They send out thieves and babysnatchers during worldgen, making them hostile.

In terms of weapons, they favor sword-type weapons, and also weapons with scythe-like blades - including war sickles and war scythes.

All satyrs can use a battle fury interaction.

There are two variants.

Regular satyrs can shadowmeld, instantly going into stealth - they are also bigger than most other elves.

Nightmare Satyrs are rare, large variants which serve as the civilization leaders. They have six protrusions coming from their back,
ending in scythe-like blades that they can use for attacking.
They can cast two spells - Bloodlust, which temporarily increases strength by 1700, and increased speed to 140% - additionally,
it prevents affected creatures from feeling fear. They can also cast Waking Nightmare, which causes severe drowsiness,
and has a chance of driving the creature insane, potentially having them lash out at nearby friendly creatures.

They can make felsteel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gnome - small, wiry humanoids, fond of engineering. They live in mountain fortresses.

They are benign, and learn mechanics, siegecrafting, and siege operating at five times the usual rate.

Gnomes have access to several rare and unique weapons - most notably Steam Hammers, which have a faster attack speed and more velocity, but are also unbalancing -
they also use Rivet Guns - ranged weapons which fire sharp rivets at a faster velocity than crossbows.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tinkerer Goblin - small, green humanoids, rivals of the gnomes in terms of technological inventions. They live in cities in tropical forests.

Most goblins are very greedy, and also learn mechanics, siegecrafting, and siege operating at five times the usual rate.

Similarly to gnomes, goblins have access to several rare weapon types - in their case, its Buzz-swords, which have a slower
"saw" attack that is slower but recovers faster, and a stab attack that is faster but also takes longer to recover from.
Aside from Rivet Guns, they also use Scrap Guns - ranged weapons that fire balls of scrap metal at a high velocity, dealing blunt impact damage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saberon - large, wildcat-like humanoids, living in forest retreats in the tropical forests.

They can use Shadowmeld to instantly enter stealth. They have access to most primitive types of weapons, and also both
bladed and blunt tonfas.

They will be hostile due to sending thieves out in worldgen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worgen - cursed humans, who take the form of wolf-like humanoids. They live in towns in grasslands and shrublands.

Their ethics, values, and weapon sets are similar to those of regular humans.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethereal - energy-based beings with characteristic mummy-like wrappings. They live in cities in the grasslands.

They are mostly a non-hostile mercantile race, prone to greediness and excitement seeking.

They can use a battle fury interaction. Their weapon sets are similar to those of goblins and gnomes,
however instead of buzz-swords or steam hammers they only have two-bladed swords. They learn mechanics,
siegecrafting and siege operating at five times the usual rate.

Defeating them may be tough, as the only way to kill them is to destroy the soul gem located in their chest.
They do not feel pain, cannot be blinded, stunned, over-exerted or made nauseous, and don't need to breathe, eat, drink or sleep.

Their unarmed attacks, including their kicks, are all edged and can sever limbs fairly easily.

On death, they dissipate into a burst of energy, leaving only whatever they were carrying at the time.

They take increased damage from Ghost Iron weapons.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forsaken - undead elves, humans and gnomes who live in cities in the grasslands and shrublands.

Similarly to the demons, they are more of a "faction" that is composed of multiple races.

All variants can use a battle fury interaction.

Forsaken Human - undead humans with glowing yellow eyes. They are the most common variant,
and learn most melee combat skills at twice the normal rate.

Forsaken Elf - undead elves with glowing red eyes. Slightly less common than the humans.
They learn ambusher and most ranged combat skills, including throwing, at twice the usual rate.

Forsaken Gnome - undead gnomes. The least common variant, they learn architecture at three times the usual rate,
and mechanics, siegecrafting and siege operating at five times the usual rate.

Forsaken Banshee - semi-corporeal spirits of elf women. They are as common as the gnomes.
They consist only of a floating humanoid torso, making them tough to knock down. They have several abilities at their disposal - a Sonic Wave
projectile that does strong blunt damage, a Scream that induces fear in nearby enemy creatures, Anti-Magic Shell, which makes the creature immune to various forms of magic,
and Curse, which reduces combat rolls for the affected creature. They take increased damage from Ghost Iron weapons.

The Forsaken caravans come during the winter, and due to having access to evil animals, they may sell them as well.
Their weapon loadouts are mostly derivated from the human and high elf civs - they also occasionally use war scythes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Undead - a faction of various undead creatures - damned mortals, spirits, zombified beings, artifical monstrosities, and skeletal monsters. 
They live in cities in the taigas, tundras, temperate forests, shrublands and mountains. 

They send out babysnatchers and thieves in worldgen, making them hostile to most other races.

The undead factions consist of many different creatures that can be divided into groups.

Cultists and other intelligent undead:

Damned - standard, human cultists - one of the most common castes.
They are the same size as regular humans, and can only use a battle fury interaction - 
however, they do not possess any magical knowledge yet.

Plague Cultist - larger cultists, versed in disease magic. They have much higher natural disease resistance.
They can cast several spells: 
Rotting Plague, which causes severe nausea and necrosis
Unstable Affliction, which causes swelling, oozing, and can also make a creature feverish and behave erratically
Internal Hemorrhage, which causes nausea, vomiting blood, and bleeding from the guts,
Animate Plaguebearer, which raises corpses as plaguebearer minions.

Unholy Cultists - another type of larger cultist - these ones are versed in necromancy.
They can raise dead bodies either as regular zombies or as ghoul minions - they can also cast 
Cripple, which decreases speed and strength to 25%, toughness to 75%, and endurance and agility to 50%;
and Curse of Agony, which lowers willpower to 40% and causes dizziness - with a slight chance of causing enough pain to instantly
knock the targetted creature unconscious.

Vargul - undead but still intelligent Vrykul. They learn most ranged and melee combat skills at twice the usual rate.
They can also use a berserker rage self-buff.

Darkfallen - undead, vampiric elves, often assigned to noble positions.
They can suck blood from unconscious creatures, and also use a battle fury interaction, cast Hemorrhagic Fever, which causes vomiting blood, a fever,
and light bleeding - and Blood Boil, which can cause bleeding, swelling, vomiting blood and coughing blood.

Crypt Fiend - undead nerubians. They are similar to their living counterparts, only with advantages of being undead -
they possess the same web spray and battle fury as the regular nerubians.

Crypt Lord - undead spiderlords. As with the crypt fiends, they are similar to their living counterparts, merely
possessing the advantages of undeath. They have the same battle fury interaction.

Lich King - half-giant lords of the undead. Usually only one exists per undead civilization - they are always the main
civilizational leaders. They have talented sword skill by default, and learn it at five times the usual rate - 
they also learn fighting and archery at twice the usual rate.
They have many different spells and abilities - they can use a battle fury interaction, raise corpses as either zombies, ghouls, 
plaguebearers, skeletons, or skeleton mages, they can cast Frost Bolt and Shadow Bolt, both of which do strong blunt damage (shadow bolt can be aimed at multiple targets),
shoot a bolt of liquid frost that causes blistering and slower speed, Death Coil which can empower the undead, but causes bleeding, necrosis and a reduction in willpower
in the living, and Frost Shock which can cause pain, blistering, and reduces speed to 30%.

Constructs and mutated zombies.
Plague Eruptor - mutated zombies covered in pustules. They can enter a berserker rage, spray a stream of plague sludge that can
cause necrosis, erratic behavior, and potentially drive the creature to attack anything nearby; or breathe a stream of plague gas
that can cause dizziness, a fever, and coughing up blood. Their bites can spray the plague sludge over wounds.

Ghoul - zombies who ascended into true undeath. They stand upright unlike their feral cousins. Their bites and scratches
can spray liquid rot over the wound, which can cause nausea, necrosis, and blistering. They can enter a berserker rage.

Flesh Giant - constructs pieced together from the bodies of giants. They can enter a berserker rage.
They learn architecture, metalcrafting, smelting strand extraction, weapon, armor and metalsmithing at twice the usual rate.

Flesh Titan - gargantuan constructs, with metallic plates covering some bits of their body.
Aside from a berserker rage, they can shoot a burst of lightning that can cause blistering, bleeding and paralysis,
or use a Paralyzing Shock that can cause pain and paralysis. Out of all the constructs, they are the most rare, but also
the largest.

Flesh Beast - strange constructs made out from pieces of various species. They have many redundant, nonfunctional 
limbs, and eyes in strange places.
They can enter a berserker rage and either spew a stream of festering goo, which can cause a fever, blisters, necrosis
and swelling, or release an undirected cloud of vile gas, which can cause a fever, nausea, vomiting blood, and erratic behavior.

Abomination - most common of the constructs, they have two large arms, and a smaller one on their back. 
They can enter a berserker rage, and also release an undirected disease cloud that can cause dizziness,
coughing blood, vomiting blood, and nausea. They themselves cannot be made nauseated.

Blight Aberration - one of the most rare forms of the construct, they are a combination of machinery and flesh.
Their torso, head, and arms are flesh and bone - whereas their entire lowers are made out of metal. 
Their hands have attachments - one arm has a hammer attachment that can be used for a strong blunt blow,
and the other has a syringe attachment that can inject living ooze into a creature, causing severe pain, vomiting blood,
necrosis, blisters, and erratic behavior.
They too can enter a berserker rage. They also cannot be blinded, as they lack eyes. The metallic canisters and tubes 
on their body serve as weak spots, and severing them can cause rapid bleeding out.

Spirits - all types are weak to Ghost Iron:
Banshee - floating, female spirits. They are similar to the forsaken banshees, and have the same unique attacks.

Spectre - male equivalent to the banshees. While they can curse their opponents and utilize the battle fury self-buff same as the banshees,
they do not possess the banshees screaming attack or their sonic wave, instead they can cast Nightmarish Sickness, which can cause a fever, drowsiness, and dizziness,
and Chains of Darkness, which temporarily reduces speed to 10%. Like the banshees, on death they dissipate into a burst of energy, leaving behind
only the objects they had in their possession.

Val'kyr - ascended spirits of vrykul females. They can fly, and are made out of both intangible energy and metallic bits of armor that cover them.
Their physical attacks mostly count as edged, though they do have a standard punch. They have a weakness in the soul gem in their torso.
They can use a battle fury, and also resurrect other nearby undead. On death they burst into light, leaving only their possessions behind.

Shade - intangible spirits composed of dark mist.
They can avoid traps, however they will flee quickly at signs of resistance. Destroying the soul gem in their torso is the only
way to kill them.
They only have a jab and scratch attack, both of which cause edged damage. 
They can cast a blinding spell when fleeing from combat, and also cast Shadow Word, which has a chance of causing severe pain.
On death, they dissipate into mist.

Skeletal beings:
Skeleton - one of the most common undead. They do not feel fear, pain, or exertion - destroying their skull is the only way to kill them.

Skeleton Mage - larger and more intelligent, but also less common form of the skeletons. They have a soul gem in their chest that is one of the ways
to dispose of them. They can cast Slow, reducing the speed of a target creature, hurl a bolt of magma, and cast Polymorph,
which has a chance of turning a target creature into a defenseless sheep.

Lich - powerful skeletal sorcerers, composed only of a floating torso. Males have horns and tusks - females lack those.
They can animate dead bodies as skeletons or skeleton mages, hurl multiple bolts of frost that do strong blunt damage,
breathe a cloud of frost that causes blistering and slowness, and also cast Frost Shock. 
On death, they dissipate into a cloud of frost that has similar effects to their frost breath.

Bone Wraith - amalgamations of various skeletal remains. They have four skulls serving as their heads, and a pair of wings - otherwise they
are only a floating torso.
They learn most melee and ranged weapon skills at twice the usual rate - with the exception of axes, which they learn at four times the usual rate,
and bows and crossbows, for which they only have a 1.5 modifier.

Bone Golem - large, brutish skeletons. They have two metallic blades attached to their hands, which they can utilize for more powerful melee attacks.

Coldwraith - skeletal magi infused with shadow and frost. Relatively rare, however their magical abilities are powerful.
They can cast Curse of Weakness, which for a short period cuts the affected creature's strength to 10% and Freezing Wind, which causes strong pain and
moderate bleeding. They also can hurl a single bolt of frost at a target. Their most deadly ability is a spell that raises dead bodies as more Coldwraiths -
while it has a long cooldown and is only capable of raising a single dead body at a time, the risen Coldwraith has the same abilities, including the animation spell.
When unchecked it can potentially spiral out of control.

Universally, all undead do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.

The undead have many different types of weapons at their disposal - they are one of the few races to use ceremonial swords;
they are also the only race with access to runeblades.

They can use Saronite - combined with their various castes, this makes them incredibly dangerous.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frost Vrykul - relatives of the vrykul, who live in cities in the taigas and mountains.

They are more violent and prone to excitement seeking than the regular Vrykul - otherwise they are mostly
similar in terms of weapon loadouts and so on.

Attacks against them have their velocity reduced by 1/3. They can also make Titansteel equipment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taunka - bison-like humanoids related to the Tauren. They live in citis in the mountains, taigas, and temperate
coniferous forests.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zandalari Troll - progenitors of the troll races. They live in tropical broadleaf forests, savannas and grasslands.

Their weapon loadouts are slightly different from those of other trolls - they are one of the races that use macuahuitls
and ceremonial swords.

They can enter a berserker rage, and can also enter a martial trance.

Drinking a volatile brew of strength as a Zandalari Troll will turn them into a Dire Troll, increasing strength and size, but lowering the speed at which they learn skills.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gnoll - primitive, hyena-like humanoids, who live in cities in the forests, savannas and grasslands.

which are artificial beings resembling male Mogu, only made entirely out of stone. They do not feel fear, pain, or exertion,
cannot be stunned or made nauseous, don't need to eat, breathe, drink or sleep, and cannot overexert.

Male and female Mogu can use a battle fury interaction - the Stoneborn cannot.

Saurok - primitive, lizard-like humanoids. They live in forest retreats in the grasslands and savannas.

They send out thieves in worldgen, and will be hostile.

They have three different varieties - standard Saurok, which don't have special abilities; Frilled Saurok,
who have retractable neck frills and can spit globs of acid - their bites will also spatter acid over wounds;
and lastly, the Primordial Saurok who are gruesomely mutated, with many tumors and bone spikes covering their bodies.
