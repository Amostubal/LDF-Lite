Animalistic
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cerberus - three-headed, firebreathing wolf. It breathes shorter-ranged fire jets (potentially in three different directions), and its heads can attack up to
3 different creatures, similarly to hydra heads.

Gorynych - a three-headed dragon, gargantuan even compared to other dragons. Can breathe dragonfire in up to three different directions - its attack triggers are higher
than other megabeasts.

Barghest - counts as a semimegabeast - a large dog-like beast with three eyes. Can shoot a bolt of shadow as a ranged attack, and also use Shadow Walk, which slightly
boosts its agility, and increases its speed to 200%.

Manticore - a quadruped with a humans face, a stinger, and two wings. It can fly and its stinger can inject a venom that causes necrosis, pain, and dizziness.

Sphinx - a quadruped with feathered wings and a human face. They are capable of flight, and inhabit shrines. They do not feel fear or pain and cannot be stunned.
They can pose a riddle to a single target, which reduces focus to 25%, and has a chance of causing dizziness or erratic behavior.

Orthrus - a two-headed wolf-like beast, related to the Cerberus.
While smaller, they are capable of breathing two different elements; either frost or lightning.

Orochi - a gargantuan snake-like beast with eight heads and eight tails. Like the hydra, it is capable of attacking with all of its heads at once.

Ladon - a five-headed, two-legged dragonic beast with a pair of wings.

Each of its heads possesses a different breath attack - they can spit balls of fire, liquid lightning, liquid frost, acid, or chunks of stone.
Cutting off a head will disable one of the breath attacks.

Opinicus - a giant quadruped resembling a cross between a griffin and a dragon. It has both scales and feathers and a toothy beak.

They can either breathe a jet of fire, or spit a ball of magma.

Catoblepas - a gigantic quadruped with the hooved body of a bovine and the head of a hog. It has three horns.

They are capable of breathing a cloud of diseased gas that can cause nausea, dizziness, and swelling of the lungs.

Attacks against them have their velocity reduced by half.

Medusa - a female creature with snakes for hair and a serpents tail. Can use a petrifying stare, which has a chance of instantly turning a victim into a stone statue.
Its snake hair can attack potentially multiple limbs or creatures at the same time. Possesses a master skill level in bow and archer skills, and talented in 
swords, daggers, striking, wrestling, biting, and fighting. Can potentially become a civ leader in worldgen.

Kampe - female half-dragon creature, with a female torso and four legs - has wings, a stinger, snakes for hair, and several animal heads on the lower body.
The animal heads are non-essential to its functioning - only severing its main head would instantly kill it. Its snake hair has similar properties to that of the Medusa,
and its venom can cause swelling, necrosis, and potentially pain. It is capable of breathing a jet of fire. Lastly, it has accomplished sword skill, and talented in biting,
wrestling, striking, and fighting. Despite being considered as semi-megabeasts in-game, resulting in higher numbers, they also have higher attack triggers than other megabeasts.

Scylla - a water nymph. Its lower body diverges into several tentacles. The creatures abdomen has three wolf heads and five serpent heads - both can attack multiple points similarly
to a hydra. Bites from the serpent heads can inject a poison that causes oozing and vomiting blood, with a high chance of necrosis and swelling. It is also capable of lashing with 
its tails. However, the nymph herself doesnt attack - as with the Kampe, decapitating the main torso is the only way to kill the creature short of bleeding it out. 
While more of them will show in worldgen, they have identical attack triggers to regular megabeasts. The Scylla has expert striking, wrestling and biting, and adept fighting.

Hecatoncheir - a colossus with ten arms and five heads. Is immune to fear, pain or stunning, and is talented in striking, kicking, fighting, and skilled in dodging. Will sometimes take over
civs in worldgen. Can essentially be thought of as an upgraded version of the Ettin.

Gegenes - a giant of earth with six arms. Its body is made out of stone.

They often punch with all six of their fists at once - aside from that they do not have any other gimmicks.
Their attack triggers are somewhat higher than other megabeasts, and require a hundred citizens to actually have a chance of showing up.
