Brief descriptions of all non-crossover wild animal creature-like races that are playable but lack civilizations, by ZM5.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lamia - benign, female humanoids with snake tails instead of legs. Found in savage wetlands and tropical forests.

They can use several songs which grant buffs to friendly creatures nearby - an energizing song that grants two hundred points into both endurance and agility,
and inspiring song that increases strength and toughness by 200, and a courage song that prevents nearby creatures from feeling fear.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arachne - female, predatory creatures with a human female's torso and the lower body of a spider. Found underground and in savage tropical forests.

They have sharp chitinous claws instead of hands. 

Aside from being able to spray immobilizing webbing at nearby foes, their bites can also inject a venom that causes paralysis.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kikimora - nocturnal, female spirits found in savage temperate forests.

They learn ambushing at four times the regular rate of other creatures - their bites are also more deadly owing to their wolf-like heads.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Siren - female humanoids with the feathers, feet and wings of a bird. Found in the savage grasslands and wetlands.

They serve as polar opposites to the lamias - the Siren's songs instead cause various types of debilitations.
They have a cursed song that reduces strength to 70% and endurance to 60%, a fatal song that decreases combat rolls
and causes bleeding from the ears and eyes, as well as coughing blood and a strong feeling of sadness, and a sleep song
that causes dizziness and drowsiness.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valkyrie - winged, female humanoids found in the mountains.

They learn fighting, spear and shield skills at three times the rate of other creatures. They also have innately
higher toughness and strength attributes than other creatures.

They are capable of using several types of light magic, including Holy Bolt, Holy Fire, and Protection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maenad - pale-skinned nymphs found in good forests. They have a pair of curling horns on their head.

They are mischievous, and will also steal food and booze from your fortress.

They learn brewing, dancing and singing at thrice the normal rate.

Their behavior is rather erratic - if provoked they may enter either a rage or a trance, making them potentially dangerous.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chort - large, cowardly male demons. Found in any evil biome.

They have hooves and horns, and are larger than humans. They will attempt to pull levers and steal goods, booze or food from your fortress.
